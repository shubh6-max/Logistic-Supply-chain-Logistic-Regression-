# Logistic-Supply-chain-Logistic-Regression

# Supervised Learning â€“ Classification (Logistics in supply chain prediction on GL Hackathon)

# Problem Statement:
Logistics in supply chain plays a crucial role in the inventory management of the raw materials required for the operations, using ML models predict which order can get delayed in the future and hence take preventive measure.

# Outcome:
Build a model using Logistic Regression, sequential feature selection and XGBoost. So, XGBoost is the best performing model, with 0.71 f1 score.

# Key skills: 
Data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Feature engineering, Scaling, Encoding, Logistic regression, Feature selection, model selection.
